<!-- JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
Block scope
Function scope/local scope
Global scope

Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

example:{
    let x = 2;
  }
  // x can NOT be used here

  Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block. -->
