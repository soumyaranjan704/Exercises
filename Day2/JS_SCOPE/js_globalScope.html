<!-- 
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope:
var x = 2;       // Global scope
let x = 2;       // Global scope
const x = 2;       // Global scope



------------Automatically Global-------
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.

This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function. -->

<h2>JavaScript Global Variables</h2>
<p>If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
myFunction();
// code here can use carName as a global variable
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I can display " + carName;

function myFunction() {
  carName = "Volvo";
}
</script>
