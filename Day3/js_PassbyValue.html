<!-- Pass By Value:
 In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of 
the variable as an argument. So any changes made inside the function does not affect
 the original value.

In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy.
 So any changes made inside the function is made to the copied value not to
  the original value . -->
